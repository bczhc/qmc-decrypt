# QMC2-rust

For a C++ reference implementation, see [qmc2][gh_qmc2] project.

## About this project...

A project to learn about rust & transpiling them to wasm/js for
use in Node.JS.

As I'm still learning about Rust, expect code to be written in
an anti-pattern way.

## TODO

- [x] Add more tests
- [x] Understand how to generate test coverage
- [x] Setup GitHub Actions to build & test automatically
- [x] Extract Tencent TEA code and publish to crates.io - [tc_tea][tc_tea]
